  * Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
  * Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.
  * Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
  * Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code. Compile to efficient native code.
