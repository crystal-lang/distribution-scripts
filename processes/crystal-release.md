# Crystal release process checklist

Add an issue `Crystal release X.Y.Z` in this repo with a copy of this document. In this way it's easy to track the progress of the release.

## Release preparation

1. [ ] Announce expected release date and time span for feature freeze
   * Feature freeze is about two weeks before release
   * Set date on milestone
2. [ ] Start preparing changelog and release notes
3. [ ] Start feature freeze period
   * Either no merging of features into `master` or split off release branch for backporting bugfixes.
4. [ ] Publish release PR draft
   * It should contain the expected date of the release (~two weeks after the PR is issued).
   * It should be populated with updates to `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION`.
5. [ ] Ensure documentation for language and compiler changes and other relevant changes is up to date.
   * [Crystal Book](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-book/)
      * Update language specification
      * Update compiler manual
      * Add or update guides / tutorials?

## Release process

### Source release

1. [ ] Finalize the release PR
   * Make sure all changes are mentioned in the changelog
   * Check release date
   * Un-draft the PR
2. [ ] Split off release branch (`release/x.y`)
3. [ ] Verify Maintenance CI workflow succeeds on the HEAD of the release branch
4. [ ] Smoke test with [test-ecosystem](https://github.com/crystal-lang/test-ecosystem)
   * Run [*Test Crystal & Shards Workflow](https://github.com/crystal-lang/test-ecosystem/actions/workflows/test-crystal-shards.yml) with the release branch as `crystal_branch`.
5. [ ] Merge the release PR
6. [ ] Tag & annotate the commit with the changelog using `<M.m.p>` pattern as {version} (as a pre-release directly in GH?)
   * `git tag -s -a -m $VERSION $VERSION`
7. [ ] Publish Github release
   1. Copy the changelog section as description
   1. Binaries are added later
8. [ ] Close milestone

### Publish documentation for the release

1. [ ] Publish API docs
   1. Have `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env variables defined
      * Keys can be generated at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials (contact a Manas admin if you don't have access).
   2. Run `make -C docs publish_docs CRYSTAL_VERSION=${VERSION}` to publish docs to `api/${VERSION}`
   3. Run `make -C docs dist-redirect_latest CRYSTAL_VERSION=${VERSION}` to apply redirect from `api/latest` to `api/${VERSION}`
2. [ ] Publish language reference (TBD)

### Binary releases

1. [ ] Wait for the release build in circle CI
2. [ ] Smoke test with test-ecosystem (again)
3. [ ] Attach build artifacts to Github release
   * `crystal-*-darwin-*.tar.gz`
   * `crystal-*-linux-*.tar.gz`
   * `crystal-*.pkg`
   * `crystal-*-docs.tar.gz`
4. [ ] Push changes to OBS for building linux packages
   1. Checkout https://github.com/crystal-lang/distribution-scripts and go to [`./packages`](../packages)
   2. Configure build.opensuse.org credentials in environment variables:
      * `export OBS_USER=`
      * `export OBS_PASSWORD=`
   3. Run [`./obs-release.sh devel:languages:crystal crystal $VERSION`](../packages/obs-release.sh)
      * Uses the docker image `crystallang/osc` to run the CLI client for OBS.
      * The script creates a branch in you home project, updates the version and pushes it back to OBS.
      * You can also run the commands from that file manually and check build locally with
         * `osc build xUbuntu_20.04 x86_64`
         * `osc build Fedora_Rawhide x86_64`
   4. Now OBS builds the packages. Itâ€™s best to follow the build status in the browser:
      1. `open https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:$OBS_USER:branches:devel:langauges:crystal/crystal`
      1. Wait for all package build jobs to finish and succeed
   5. Verify package installation
      * `OBS_PROJECT=home:$OBS_USER:branches:devel:languages:crystal bats test`
   6. When everything is green, create a submit request against the original package (*Submit package* link in the menu bar on the package in your branch)
5. [ ] Tag `latest` docker images
   * Versioned docker images have been pushed to dockerhub.
   * Now just assign the `latest` tags:
   * `$ ./docker/apply-latest-tags.sh {version}`
6. [ ] Publish snap package
   1. You need to logged in via `$ snapcraft login`
   1. Recent tagged release is published directly to edge channel. The CI logs the snap revision number. Otherwise the .snap file is in the artifacts.
   1. Check the current status to find the revision of the tagged release otherwise:
   1. `$ snapcraft status crystal`
   1. `$ snapcraft release crystal <revision-number> beta`
   1. `$ snapcraft release crystal <revision-number> stable`
7. [ ] Submit a PR to update the homebrew formula in https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/crystal.rb .
   1. Update the previous and new version (with their respective hashes).
   1. Try locally `$ brew install --build-from-source <source of formula>`
   1. Create PR
